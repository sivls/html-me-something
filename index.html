                <h2>What is Dagorhir?</h2>
                <p>Created in 1977 by a group of friends with a love of history and of the works of JRR Tolkien, Dagorhir (Tolkien Elvish for "Battle 
                Lords") is a combination of live-action roleplay and fast-paced full-contact combat with foam weapons. Participants (known as 
                "Dagorhirrim") create characters to portray in the game, from something as simple as an alternate name to go by, to something as 
                elaborate as a fully fleshed out persona with its own backstory and lineage. These personas, typically chosen from a fantasy setting 
                or a real-world setting up to the 15th century (though this is heavily debated), can be anything from a fantasy creature like an orc 
                or an elf, to a creature from folklore like an oni or a banshee, to something like a real-world viking or Roman soldier. Dagorhir 
                battles are held at events that range from simple gatherings in local parks to massive campouts with people from around the world, 
                the largest of which (known as Ragnarok) draws over a thousand people.</p>

                <h2>How do I play?</h2>
                <p>Dagorhir battles come in all shapes and sizes. Some battles may be as simple as teams fighting until they're the last team standing, 
                some may involve defending a point or an object, and some are similar to games like capture the flag. Battles can range from a few dozen 
                fighters to hundreds, depending on the event.</p>
                <p>There are nearly endless possibilities for the kinds of weapons you can fight with, whether you prefer a sword and shield, a bow 
                and arrow, a spear, etc. Weapons are commonly constructed of a solid core material (PVC, carbon fiber tubing, etc.) wrapped in 
                different kinds of foam and cloth to create a safe striking surface. A great way to immerse yourself more fully in the game while 
                protecting yourself from other people's weapons (they may be made of foam, but they can still leave some nasty bruises!) is to get 
                yourself a good set of armor. Anything from leather to chainmail to full plate can be found on the field. And while there are many places 
                to buy these things ready-made, it's well worth the time and effort to make your own.</p>

                <h2>But what if I'm tired of fighting for the day, or I just don't want to fight?</h2>
                <p>On the non-combat side of things, Dagorhir has a thriving community of artists and craftspeople, making anything from Dagorhir 
                clothing (called 'garb'), armor, and weapons, to home-brewed wine and mead, to period-accurate furniture, and everything in between. 
                Many large events even offer classes (taught by Dagorhirrim) for a variety of fiber arts, armor making, and many other period-accurate 
                art forms - this is all usually referred to under the heading of "Arts & Sciences". In addition to tangible goods and art like those 
                previously mentioned, Dagorhir has a large community of performers. There are competitions and exhibitions for musical 
                performance, dancing, and story telling that rival the spectacle of even the biggest field battle.</p>
                <p>Also, there are some incredible parties and nightlife events. Like an actual Thunderdome, complete with a 
                flame-throwing guitar. Or a carnival run by your friendly local fantasy creatures. Or a hafla, showcasing the very best belly dancers 
                in the Dagorhir community. There's truly something for everyone at a Dagorhir event.</p>

                <h2>What is the Dagorhir community like?</h2>
                <p>Dagorhir is split up into chapters, bigger groups that meet for practices, and further split into units, 
                smaller groups that camp together, fight together, and are often more like family than friends. There are units for 
                every play style and time period, from legions of Roman soldiers to packs of orcs and goblins. Some are more focused on 
                fighting, while others are more focused on the other things Dagorhir has to offer.</p>
                <p>I'm a member of the unit known as Blood Horde, a group of fantasy creatures that believe in unity and equality. Members of 
                Blood Horde are not solely judged on their combat abilities, but on their spirit and their contributions to the unit and the game 
                as a whole, on or off the battlefield. Going to an event with Blood Horde is like going to a family reunion with my 75 favorite 
                cousins. We may be spread across the country, but when we get together, we are a force of nature. Our members are deeply involved 
                in the well-being of the game, to the point that, at the last Ragnarok before the pandemic, our camp averaged over 100 more volunteer 
                hours during the event than any other camp. We truly love our community and each other.</p>
                <p>On a more personal note, this is where I believe Dagorhir truly sets itself apart from other hobbies. Dagorhirrim are hands-down 
                the best people I've ever met. Dagorhirrim are people who will move heaven and earth for their units and total strangers alike. In a 
                sport that has the potential to draw a lot of unsavory folk, Dagorhirrim continue to be staunch supporters of the marginalized people 
                within their ranks and a force for good. Dagorhirrim will utterly destroy you and your entire unit on the battlefield, then turn around 
                and give you a pep talk while offering you a beer and a seat around their fire - true story. They are truly a light in the darkness. 
                The family I have found means the world to me, and I can't wait until it's safe for me to be with them again.</p>
